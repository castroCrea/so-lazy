                            <p class="text-left">Can you remember the first time you felt the superpower of using a CLI?</p>

<p class="text-left">We want to bring this delightful experience - that engineers enjoy daily - to everyone.</p>

<p class="text-left">CLIs can be intimidating and feel like a black box for non-technical people and thus were never really adopted widely because of their learning curve.</p>

<p class="text-left">But at Lazy we strongly believe that we can reunify the experience of a CLI with a classical GUI to build what we call a CLUI: an intuitive interface with a small learning curve that blends GUIs and CLIs to perform actions in the quickest and most intuitive way possible.</p>

<p class="text-left">Today CLIs are back, but hidden under the name of search and we think it's the perfect time to lend cachet to all the efficiency of the original CLIs.</p>

<p class="text-left">With that in mind, we launched the first version of Lazy and became the IoT <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/posts/lazy">Product of the Year 2019</a> on Product Hunt.</p>

<p class="text-left">We're now applying that same UX paradigm to the world of ideas, thoughts and tasks: the next level of Lazy is a smart CLUI that captures a thought with its context at the speed of a keyboard shortcut.</p>

<p class="text-left">Often when you are in the middle of something, a thought comes to mind that you need to write down, whether it's a lightbulb moment or a reminder. With Lazy, you can write down that thought with a UX that reduces the cognitive cost of jotting something down, respecting your precious flow, and always designed for speed because the most valuable thing in the world is time.</p>

<p class="text-left">We believe that CLUI is the perfect tool to capture anything from anywhere but unfortunately that wonâ€™t help you to be a better thinker or get more done unless there is a good system behind to process those thoughts. That's why we're also building what we call a *Universal Inbox* to collect all your captures.</p></p>
