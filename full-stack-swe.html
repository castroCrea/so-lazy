                                <div class="text-left mt-32">Can you remember the first time you felt the superpower of using a CLI?</div>

                                <div class="text-left mt-8">We want to bring this delightful experience - that engineers enjoy daily - to everyone.</div>

                                <div class="text-left mt-8">CLIs can be intimidating and feel like a black box for non-technical people and thus were never really adopted widely because of their learning curve.</div>

                                <div class="text-left mt-8">But at Lazy we strongly believe that we can reunify the experience of a CLI with a classical GUI to build what we call a CLUI: an intuitive interface with a small learning curve that blends GUIs and CLIs to perform actions in the quickest and most intuitive way possible.</div>

                                <div class="text-left mt-8">Today CLIs are back, but hidden under the name of search and we think it's the perfect time to lend cachet to all the efficiency of the original CLIs.</div>

                                <div class="text-left mt-8">With that in mind, we launched the first version of Lazy and became the IoT <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/posts/lazy">Product of the Year 2019</a> on Product Hunt.</div>

                                <div class="text-left mt-8">We're now applying that same UX paradigm to the world of ideas, thoughts and tasks: the next level of Lazy is a smart CLUI that captures a thought with its context at the speed of a keyboard shortcut.</div>

                                <div class="text-left mt-8">Often when you are in the middle of something, a thought comes to mind that you need to write down, whether it's a lightbulb moment or a reminder. With Lazy, you can write down that thought with a UX that reduces the cognitive cost of jotting something down, respecting your precious flow, and always designed for speed because the most valuable thing in the world is time.</div>

                                <div class="text-left mt-8">We believe that CLUI is the perfect tool to capture anything from anywhere but unfortunately that won’t help you to be a better thinker or get more done unless there is a good system behind to process those thoughts. That's why we're also building what we call a *Universal Inbox* to collect all your captures.</div>

                        <p class="text-left">These different workflows make us rethink productivity from the first principle and it brings a wide range of technical challenges. We need remarkable engineering to pull it off. As a member of our small team, you’ll have a massive impact and plenty of opportunities to both leverage your existing strengths and learn new skills.</p>

                        <h2 class="section-title text-left">What You'll Do</h2>

                        <p class="text-left mt-16">- You'll first build the core features of our MVP closely with our CTO from start to finish — by breaking down high-level goals into tasks and timelines.
                        - You'll then take ownership of the features that you develop. Think features to improve the format of captures that we support, such as a tweet storm captured in a neat way into your *universal inbox*.
                        - You'll build improvements to performance, reliability and product polish — making the Lazy infrastructure scalable and monitor end-user experience. E.g. making every interaction faster than 100ms because it is the threshold where interactions feel instantaneous.
                        - You'll take the lead on important subjects such as the text editor stream.
                        - You'll be in the mindset of mentoring, coaching and supporting a future engineering team from helping in the interview process and recruiting talented engineers.
                        - Technologies we use:  React, Redux, Electron, REST API, Docker, Heroku
                            - Technologies we might consider using: Golang, GraphQL, `?`</p>
